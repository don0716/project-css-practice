Having a solid understanding of the basics of CSS is crucial for web development. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language used to control the presentation and styling of web content.
I will be going through the following with exercises in order to refresh my mind with all the CSS basics.

1. **Box Model**: Understand the CSS box model, which includes elements like margin, border, padding, and content. This is fundamental to understanding how elements are laid out on a web page.

2. **Selectors**: Learn how to select HTML elements using different CSS selectors. The most common ones are element selectors, class selectors, and ID selectors.

3. **Properties and Values**: Familiarize yourself with common CSS properties and their values. Some essential properties include `color`, `font-size`, `margin`, `padding`, `background`, and `border`.

4. **Text Styling**: Learn how to style text using properties like `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, and `text-align`. Understand how to style links and pseudo-classes like `:hover`.

5. **Layout**: Understand the basics of layout in CSS. Learn about properties like `display`, `position`, `float`, and `clear`. Also, explore the concepts of flexbox and grid layout, which are powerful tools for creating responsive designs.

6. **Responsive Design**: Learn how to create responsive layouts using media queries. Media queries allow you to adjust styles based on the screen size or device type.

7. **Box Sizing**: Understand the `box-sizing` property, which affects how the width and height of elements are calculated, and its common values like `content-box` and `border-box`.

8. **Specificity and Inheritance**: Understand the concept of specificity, which determines which CSS rule takes precedence when there are conflicting styles. Also, learn how styles can be inherited from parent elements.

9. **CSS Transitions and Animations**: Explore how to create smooth transitions and animations using CSS properties like `transition` and `animation`.

10. **CSS Box Shadows and Gradients**: Learn how to create shadows and gradients to enhance the visual appeal of elements.

11. **Pseudo-elements and Pseudo-classes**: Understand pseudo-elements like `::before` and `::after`, and pseudo-classes like `:first-child` and `:last-child`.

12. **Positioning and Z-Index**: Master positioning properties like `relative`, `absolute`, and `fixed`, and how to control the stacking order of elements with `z-index`.

13. **CSS Flexbox and Grid**: Dive deeper into CSS layout by learning how to use flexbox and grid for complex and responsive layouts.

14. **Debugging**: Get familiar with browser developer tools for debugging CSS issues, inspecting elements, and experimenting with styles.
